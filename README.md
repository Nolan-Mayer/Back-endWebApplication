# Back-endWebApplication

//Nolan Mayer//

This complete back-end web application demonstrates the use of REST API endpoints to perfrom all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on a basic collection.
This application uses C#, IDE is visual studio.

You can test this application using many different methods but I personally used postman.
